PRISMA IS  a node.js and typescript orm
this means it can actually work with different types of database systems as others (mysql, sqlserver, sqllite and mongodb)

ther all are supported by prisma


let's first install the prisma client
and so we'll copy that package name and in vsc terminal type
npm install and we're going to install that package

npm install @prisma/client

we're also gonna install prisma cli which is gonna help us as we eork
with prisma and as we use different features

npm install --save-dev prisma

now that cli is installed qe can
npx prisma init
to run it

automatically we gonna have a prisma dirrectory created

with schema.prisma

here we gonna configure anything we need for our prisma setup , telling our
prisma how to connect with our database
and later we'l be adding new info
we now have the default setup to use postgres
ad we have the url where it's acutally require environment variable

we now in our .env file
can se the edited file by prisma, we can delete the comments and
look at what has been put in that file:
we're going to be connected with postgres
and we can change te username jon doe with our development username putting our
password afterit and set the port postgres database server is listening on
our database called space_facts and we can leave schema=public
to have DATABASE_URL="postgresql://AndreaBarberio:password@localhost:3000/space_facts?schema=public"
