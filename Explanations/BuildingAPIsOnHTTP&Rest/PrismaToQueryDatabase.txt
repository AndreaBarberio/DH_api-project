Integrate a Prisma Client into our app and use it to query database

In order to use Prisma client we first need to import it
so lets go in app.ts and let's do it
we can chek if it is in our p.json as a dependency

so we now want to creat a new instance of prisma client so
let's initialize a variable called prisma and usin new keyword let's say

new Prisma Client

that gives us a prisma client wchich allows us now to go and querying against database

so we will replace the handler that we have created

`
 response.json([
        {
            name: "Mercury",
        },

        {
            name: "Venus",
        }]
    );
`

SO IT GETS RECORDS FROM OUR DATABASE

so let's initialise planets variable equal to awaiting planets from prisma,
with dot notation, so

const planets = await prisma.planet.findMany()

the prisma client has types that are generated when we add models
that means that it updates and we get all this kind of rich type hinting and type checking
adding findMany() which is a method that pullback more than one record, so all the planet that we have

then we're going to send back that planet there shpuld
be an array of planets that is send back as a response body
asking to be formatted as json

using await gets an error because it needs to be inside of
an async function,
so let's make it async by adding before the parameters in the app.get function callback

so now we can save, open postman and make a test request to it

creating a new collection
