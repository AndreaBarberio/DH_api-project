To create a server with wxpress we need to install it

$ npm install express

we are going to installe type for express so

$ npm install --save-dev @types/express

an another package we have to install is ExpressJS Async Errors

it is important bcause provides safety in using promises, async/await
$ npm install express-async-errors


let's initialize, defining our first root: in express

it means app.get, which is the method to call a request
encoding "/" passing then a callback function, and it is a root handler
passing request and response, this function will run a requestwhich comes in for slash root
on our api using get http method

we are sending back the response, sending message "up and running

defining a variable which is the port, we can define where our server gonna run
adding a listen() we can link our port to make the app.listen to the port we set
